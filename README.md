1. How does TypeScript enforce type safety in this program?

TypeScript enforces type safety by making sure that variables, function parameters, and class properties are only used with the correct data types

2. How did inheritance reduce code duplication for PhysicalProduct and DigitalProduct?

Both PhysicalProduct and DigitalProduct share common properties and methods from Products. So sku, name, price, and displayDetails() in both Physical and Digital products, inheritance allows them to reuse the base class Product. Reduces duplicate code and maintenance easier

3. What are the benefits of using encapsulation and access modifiers?

Encapsulation provides controlling access to class data using public, private, and protected.
Polymorphism allows  to treat objects of different subclasses as the same base class (Product).
